         <p>While supporting slow-fashion by using handmade goods is sustainable, there is much more to that..</p>
         <img class="sustainablephoto" src="images/woolgraphic.png">
         <p>We wish to be transparent about our materials and products. Right now, we have used acrylic and polyester in many
            of our products. These are synthetic fibers that are harmful to the environment, which is why we are transitioning to eco-friendly materials. Some natural, biodegradable, and non-toxic yarns include organic cotton, tencel, wood, and silk.
         </p>
         <p>Organic cotton is grown using methods that have a low impact on the environment. Organic production prohibits the use
            of toxic chemicals or synthetic fertilizers. Tencel is made from a regerated fabric that is made from sustainably sources eucalyptus in a closed loop process.
         </p>
         <img class="sustainablephoto" src="images/plantgraphic.png">
         <p>Our goal is to use the most sustainable materials that we can afford. Naturally, this means that our production costs
            will increase significantly. We encourage everyone to take into consideration the labor and costs that are put into our products. This will allow us to continue our
            small shop and give us the opportunity to reduce our impact on the environment.
         </p>
         <p>Thank you!</p>
